# ImGui External Example
This is an example project demonstrating the use of the ImGui library in C# for creating graphical user interfaces in various applications. It includes a basic overlay with ImGui features and a memory attachment functionality.

## Overview

The code in this repository showcases the following features:

- Creating an overlay using the ClickableTransparentOverlay library.
- Implementing ImGui for user interface elements such as buttons, toggles, sliders, and text areas.
- A demonstration of different ImGui features within a "ImGui Features" tree node.
- Memory attachment to a target process using the `Memory` library.
- Basic error handling and status display for the attachment process.

## Usage

To use this code as a starting point for your own project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Customize the overlay and ImGui elements in the `RenderClass.cs` file to suit your needs.
3. Modify the memory attachment logic to work with your specific target application.
4. Build and run the project.
